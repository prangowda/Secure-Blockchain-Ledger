# Secure Blockchain Ledger

## 🔍 Project Description
Secure Blockchain Ledger is a **Python-based blockchain implementation** that ensures secure transactions using **SHA-256 cryptographic hashing** and **Proof of Work (PoW)**. This project demonstrates the fundamental concepts of **blockchain technology** by creating a tamper-resistant ledger.

---

## 🛠 Features
✅ **Cryptographic Security** - Each block is linked to the previous one using **SHA-256 hashing**  
✅ **Proof of Work (PoW)** - Prevents easy modifications by requiring computational effort  
✅ **Decentralized Ledger** - Blocks are stored securely in a growing chain  
✅ **Integrity Verification** - Ensures data integrity by checking blockchain validity  

---

## 📜 Installation
Ensure you have **Python 3+** installed. No additional libraries are required.
```sh
pip install hashlib time
```
Run the blockchain:
```sh
python blockchain.py
```

---

## 📂 Usage
1️⃣ **Creating the Blockchain** - The system starts with a **Genesis Block** (first block).  
2️⃣ **Adding Transactions** - New transactions are added as blocks and mined using **PoW**.  
3️⃣ **Verifying Blockchain Integrity** - The blockchain checks if data is **unchanged and secure**.  

---

## 📊 Example Output
```
Block 1 mined: 0000a4f9d36e6...
Block 2 mined: 0000c7d2e5b1a...
Adding new transactions...
Blockchain valid: True
```

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
🔹 **Add Digital Signatures** for user authentication  
🔹 **Implement Smart Contracts** for automated transactions  
🔹 **Enhance PoW Algorithm** for efficiency
